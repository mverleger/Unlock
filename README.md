UNLOCK - Unique Non-Linear Organizer for Conveying Knowledge

UNLOCK is a non-linear UI for the Canvas LMS system.  Instead of using the vertical "modules" system or manually creating a rectangular page, UNLOCK provides a hexagon-based layout that encourages non-linear curricular organization.  The toolset implements multiple gamification elements, specifically
- Individual and Team leaderboards based on Canvas Groups
- A Progress Bar
- Multiple "Levels"
- A non-linear UI with level locking
- Rubric based outcomes reporting

UNLOCK integrates with Canvas in two ways:
1) Using Developer Keys to allow for Canvas API access
2) As an LTI tool for launching an authenticated user
